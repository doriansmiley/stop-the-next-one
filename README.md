# Stop The Next One
This repo is dedicated to helping prevent the next mass shooting by creating technology to help law enforcement identify threats and investigate them while staying compliant with the law and preserving civil liberties.

# Overview
We believe the next mass shooting can be prevented if we bring together community members in a sem-trusted environment where evidence can be shared without centralized servers, using onboard models to verify identities and score a case file.
We do this by securely storing all models, collected evidence and ID verification on the user's device.
Users can submit a case file to law enforcement as a group using only the scores generated by onboard models.
Once received law enforcement can request the evidence and ID verification from group members if they believe it warrants an investigation.
